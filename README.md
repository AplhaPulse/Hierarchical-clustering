# Hierarchical Clustering Implementation for Loan Data Segmentation

This repository provides a Python implementation of hierarchical clustering for segmenting loan data.

## Purpose

- Groups loan applicants into distinct segments based on their features.
- Identifies patterns and similarities within loan applicant data.
- Provides a foundation for understanding unsupervised learning in financial applications.

## Implementation

- Uses Python's `scipy` and `scikit-learn` libraries to implement hierarchical clustering.
- Allows for customization of linkage methods (e.g., Ward, complete, average).
- Implements distance metrics such as Euclidean or Manhattan distance.
- Provides functionality for visualizing dendrograms and cluster results.

## Usage

1. Install necessary Python packages (e.g., `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
2. Input your loan dataset (features).
3. Run the provided Python script (`loan_hierarchical_clustering.py`).
4. Specify the desired linkage method and distance metric.
5. Interpret output:
    - The script generates dendrograms to visualize the hierarchical clustering process.
    - Cluster assignments are provided for each loan applicant.
    - Visualizations of clusters are generated to understand the segmentation.

## Key Concepts

- **Hierarchical Clustering:** An unsupervised learning algorithm that builds a hierarchy of clusters.
- **Linkage Method:** Defines how the distance between clusters is measured (e.g., Ward, complete, average).
- **Distance Metric:** Measures the distance between loan applicant data points (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan).
- **Loan Data Segmentation:** Grouping loan applicants into distinct segments based on their features.
- **Dendrogram:** A tree-like diagram that visualizes the hierarchical clustering process.

## Output

- Dendrogram visualizations.
- Cluster assignments for loan applicants.
- Visualizations of the formed clusters.
- Information about the parameters used (linkage method, distance metrics).
